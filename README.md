# Stress Detection for IT Professionals

> A smart AI-ML powered solution to monitor and detect stress levels in IT professionals, using Rasa chatbot integration, IoT sensor inputs, and machine learning models.

---

## 📋 Project Description
"Stress Detection for IT Professionals" is a powerful system that tracks, analyzes, and reports stress levels using AI, Machine Learning, and IoT devices.  
It features a smart chatbot (built with Rasa) to interact with users, provide support, and suggest recommendations based on detected stress levels.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔹 Real-time stress detection using sensor data
- 🔹 Smart AI-powered chatbot assistant (Rasa)
- 🔹 User-friendly conversation interface
- 🔹 Machine learning model to predict stress levels
- 🔹 Data storage for long-term stress tracking
- 🔹 Alerts and recommendations for stress management

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Chatbot:** Rasa (Open Source Conversational AI)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (optional)
- **Database:** SQLite3
- **IoT Integration:** Sensor data input (optional extension)
- **Frontend (optional):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Other Tools:** Ngrok (for webhook testing)

---

## 🧠 AI/ML + Rasa Usage
- **Rasa NLU:** Identifies intents like `stress_report`, `greet`, `goodbye`, `help`.
- **Rasa Core:** Handles dialogue management using stories/rules.
- **Custom Actions:** Predicts stress level based on sensor data or user responses.
- **ML Model:** Classifies stress levels (low, medium, high) based on input features.

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Open your chatbot interface (UI/terminal).
- Greet the bot and describe your feelings or symptoms.
- Bot interacts, records inputs, runs ML model prediction, and gives a recommendation.
- Admin can view stress data over time (optional dashboard feature).

Would you like me to also **create a special badge section** at the top like GitHub projects have? (like: Build Passing ✅, Version 1.0 🚀, etc.)  
It'll make it even cooler! 😎  
Shall I add that too? 🚀
